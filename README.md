## GitHub guidelines

### Issues
For every task a issue should be created and relevant tags should be added to the issue. When creating a issue it should be added to the workboard for the repository under the "Projects" selection menu as to automate the issue. The title of the issue should be short and straigth to the points, while the description can be more in depth. Including a description is recommended and relevant tags should be added.
### Branches
Branches should be created from an issue and should in most cases use the name that GitHub generates. This can be done by choosing an issue to create a branch from, then click "Create a branch" under the "Development" selection menu.

### Commits
Each commit message should start with the on of the following verbs: **Add, Fix, Update, Delete**. The commit message should also be short and descriptive on what code has been affected and how the code has been affected.
### Pull requests
Every pull request should stem from a branch created from an issue. The description of the pull request should contain what code changes is done in comparison with the code in the main branch and a link to the respective issue must be included as to automate the pull request and issue.
